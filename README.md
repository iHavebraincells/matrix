# Matrix Hacker Toolkit

The **Matrix Hacker Toolkit** is a powerful bash script for Linux that brings together a collection of useful networking and hacking tools in a menu-driven interface. With this toolkit, you can run a Matrix-like effect on your terminal, gather IP information, ping hosts, run traceroutes, and use popular tools like John the Ripper and Hydra.

## Features

- **Matrix Effect**: Run a terminal Matrix-like effect to simulate the iconic green text animation.
- **IP Information**: View detailed IP configuration information using `ip` or `ifconfig`.
- **Ping a Host**: Easily ping any host with customizable parameters.
- **Traceroute**: Perform a traceroute to a target to check the route your packets take.
- **John the Ripper**: Launch John the Ripper for password cracking.
- **Hydra**: Run Hydra for brute force attacks on various protocols.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your Linux system:

- `cmatrix` (for Matrix effect)
- `ip` or `ifconfig` (for IP information)
- `ping`
- `traceroute`
- `john` (John the Ripper)
- `hydra` (Hydra)

These can typically be installed via your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`).
